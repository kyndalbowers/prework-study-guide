  # Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This application has been created to provide a space for me to organize and easily find notes from the 4/24 Coding Bootcamp course.  This provides one central location for me to store and reference this information, as well as potentially provide useful information for others that are learning to code.  While building this, I received an introduction to Git, GitHub, command line, VS, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
